**About Snip.it**

[Snip.it](http://snip.it) lets you collect and share your favorite web content. You can snip any articles, videos or images, and organize them into gorgeous collections. As you collect, you can also share to Twitter or Facebook with just one click - and get detailed stats on all the traffic you're getting. You can also find cool content on Snip.it in any topic that interests you, collected by the Snip.it community.

Snip.it has been featured in major newspapers and has been described as the easiest and most visually compelling curation tool on the web today.
